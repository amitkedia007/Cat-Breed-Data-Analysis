# Cat-Breed-Data-Analysis
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of a dataset about cat breeds. The project was part of the CS5802 module, a course under the Computer Science department of the College of Engineering, Design &amp; Physical Sciences (CEDPS), Brunel University London.


About the Dataset

The dataset comprises four variables - weight, breed, sex, and age of different cats. The aim is to analyze these data to uncover insights and answer specific questions raised in the exam.

Tasks and Methodology

The project includes the following key tasks:

Data Quality Analysis: This involves performing various checks on the dataset to determine its quality. Checks include looking for missing or implausible values, data type inconsistencies, and other potential issues that could affect the analysis.

Data Cleaning: After identifying potential issues, the next step is to clean the data. This could involve dealing with missing values, handling outliers, or fixing data inconsistencies.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): This step involves analyzing the data to uncover patterns, spot anomalies, test hypotheses, and check assumptions using descriptive statistics and graphical representations.

Statistical Analysis: This involves using appropriate statistical models to test hypotheses about the data. In this project, the focus is on testing whether there are significant differences in the weights of different cat breeds and whether there's a significant difference in the mean age between male and female cats.

The entire analysis process is implemented in R, making use of various libraries like ggplot2, validate, tidyr, tidyverse, and Hmisc.

Running the Code
To run the code, you will need R installed on your system. You can then clone this repository and run the R markdown file in an R environment.
